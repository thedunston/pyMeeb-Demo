WinRM messages use HTTP and HTTPS as transports. The WinRM service does not depend on IIS but is preconfigured to share a port with IIS on the same machine.  The WinRM service reserves the /wsman URL prefix. To prevent conflicts with IIS  administrators should ensure that any websites hosted on IIS do not use the /wsman URL prefix.,C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe,fa82f82b91f6809958d01198038e830b,C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe -k NetworkService,Microsoft Windows,true,The file is signed and the signature was verified.,Microsoft Windows Verification PCA
